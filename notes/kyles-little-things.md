## The Little Things™
I recently switched over to Sublime Text 2 and for the most part it's been pretty awesome. But I've been noticing a lot of little things that I really appreciate in an editor, so I thought I'd note them down.

1. Indenting soft-wrapped lines http://share.kyleneath.com/captures/_upsell.html.erb-20120127-231402.png
2. Respecting Chrome-like tab behavior (drag between windows/panes, `⌘+Shift+T` to get last closed tab back, `⌘+N` for a new tab in your current pane)
3. Indent markers http://share.kyleneath.com/captures/billing_dependency.rb-20120127-232754.png
